# Symple

Symple is a very rudimentary tool for managing Projects and Tasks.

I'm using it to test how to best integrate React with Rails 

You can find a running version here: https://csym-symple.herokuapp.com/

```sh
bundle install
yarn install
```

## First time setup:
```sh
bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate
